        <h3>Jenifer's Argument</h3>

        <p>Summer is better than winter because it is the best season. The weather is hot, and everyone is happy because they can enjoy outdoor activities. People can go to places like parks, pools and beaches. In addiction, they are able to enjoy delicious cold desserts and drinks. Life during the summer is much better.
